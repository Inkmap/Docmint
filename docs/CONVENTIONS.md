## CURL

CURL is used as a "kind of" API. The main file called for CURL is curl.php.
This must be called with a POST request.
The function to call is `curl_post` inside `libs/function.php`.

All curl "endpoints" are inside the folder `libs/curl`.
Where there would be a slash in the URL, the php files have two underscores: `__`
